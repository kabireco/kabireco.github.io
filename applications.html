		<h1>Applications</h1>
		<p>We will now cover the Lorenz Curve's applications in an Indian context:</p>
		<ol>
		<li><b>Measuring income inequality:</b> The Lorenz curve has been used in India to measure the degree of income inequality. Studies have shown that income inequality in India has increased over the years.</li>

		<li><b>Evaluating poverty:</b> The Lorenz curve has been used to evaluate poverty levels in India. For example, the government of India uses the poverty line as defined by the Lorenz curve to determine the number of people living below the poverty line (BPL).</li>

		<li><b>Government policy:</b> The Lorenz curve has been used to analyze the impact of government policies aimed at reducing poverty and income inequality, such as Mahatma Gandhi National Rural Employment Guarantee Act (MGNREGA) and the Public Distribution System (PDS).</li>

		<li><b>Studying demographic trends:</b> The Lorenz curve has been used to study changes in the distribution of income over time and between different demographic groups, such as urban and rural populations, and different caste and ethnic groups.</li>

		<li><b>Comparing states:</b> The Lorenz curve has also been used to compare the distribution of income between different states in India. This has helped the Central Government identify states with high levels of poverty and inequality and target solutions accordingly.</li>
