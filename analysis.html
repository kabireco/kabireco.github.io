        <h1>Analysis</h1>
		<p>The following is a representation of the Gini Coefficients for countries around the world (data of 2019, ratios have been converted into percentages):</p>
		<center>

		</center>
		<p>We see that countries like USA and Russia have a very high degree of wealth inequality due to a very high Gini Coefficient; India has a relatively high degree and countries like Japan have a low degree of wealth inequality (i.e., more equitable distribution of wealth).</p>
		<p>We will now do a comparative analysis. Below is a plot of the Lorenz Curves of three countries:</p>
		<center>

		</center>
		<p>We see that the curves for Hungary and Denmark are relatively close to the line of equality, and their slopes are relatively flat, therefore they have a good equality of wealth amongst citizens. In comparison, we will look at Namibia. Some features:</p>
		<ol>
			<li><b>The curve is distant from the line of equality.</b></li>
			<li><b>The curve does not have a flat slope.</b> Notice how the curve starts off very low and then there is a sudden spike, an exponential increase. This shows that as we near the last 80-100% of the cumulative population from lowest to highest income (shown between the 4th and 5th quintile), the cumulative wealth increases very sharply, implying that a small percentage of the population controls most of the wealth.</li>
		</ol>
		<p>Therefore there is a very high degree of income inequality between citizens.</p>
